all my code have been migrated to [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ditchgithub)

reasons :
  - copilot taking code without asking : not ok
  - I'm old enough to know if I want to enable MFA or not
  - I don't care about your stupid badges
  - it's 2024 and you still don't support ipv6, shame.

keeping this account for private organization and Oauth with some certification stuff...
